== How to use it ==

Upon installing the plugin you can get a complimentary trial license to use the service for 14 days. Simply install the plugin, we'll collect your email, site URL and set up your license key. Additionally if you want more functionality you can purchase a license key from our website. To do that you will need to go here: [profanity-blocker.co.uk] (http://www.profanity-blocker.co.uk/ “profanity-blocker.co.uk - Your very own Profanity Blocker”).

After you go there either log in if you are already registered or signup by following the instructions on the site. You will get a free 15 days trial Premium package right after subscribing.

The payment agreement is set right away after you create an account for your domain, but as you are shown, you are not billed until the trial license expires.

Once you set the agreement you will get your account activated and can start using it straight away.

= What will you get =
You get a Premium package as a trial (you can opt for Basic or Enterprise if you so choose, but the payment is then made the very next day). This means that you get the advanced filtering plus the email filtering, phone numbers filtering and the links filtering for 14 free days - that is if you select them in your plugin.
